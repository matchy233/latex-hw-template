\begin{homeworkProblem}

\solution

\begin{proof}
    It's trivial to see that  \[
    QQ^{T} = I = Q^{T}Q
    \] and \[
    \det(Q) = \det(Q^{T})
    \]
    We also know that fact that \[
    \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)
    \] and \[
    \det(I) = 1
    \]
    Putting these facts altogether we know that \[
        \begin{aligned}
    \det(I) &= \det(QQ^{T}) \\
    &= \det(Q)\det(Q^T) \\
    &= [\det(Q)]^2
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    So either $\det(Q) = 1$ or $\det(Q) = -1$.
\end{proof}
