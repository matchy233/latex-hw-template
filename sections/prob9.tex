\solution

\begin{proof}
    It's trivial to see that  \[
    QQ^{T} = I = Q^{T}Q
    \] and \[
    \det(Q) = \det(Q^{T})
    \]
    We also know that fact that \[
    \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)
    \] and \[
    \det(I) = 1
    \]
    Putting these facts altogether we know that \[
        \begin{aligned}
    \det(I) &= \det(QQ^{T}) \\
    &= \det(Q)\det(Q^T) \\
    &= [\det(Q)]^2
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    So either $\det(Q) = 1$ or $\det(Q) = -1$.

Let $T$ be a self-adjoint linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. Prove that $(T + iI)(T - iI)^{-1}$ is unitary using the following conclusion:
$T - iI$ is invertible and $[(T -iI)^{-1}]^* = (T + iI)^{-1}$ if $T$ is self-adjoint.

\solution

\begin{proof}
Linear operator $T$ is unitary if $TT^* = T^*T = I$.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\phantom{= } [(T + iI)(T - iI)^{-1}]^*[(T + iI)(T - iI)^{-1}]\\
&= [(T-iI)-1]^*(T+iI)^*(T+iI)(T-iI)^{-1}\\
&= (T+iI)^{-1}(T+iI)(T-iI)(T-iI)^{-1}\\
&=I
\end{aligned}
