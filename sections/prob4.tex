\begin{homeworkProblem}

For the linear operator $T$ defined by
\[
  T(A) = 2A + A^t \forall A \in M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})
\]
Find a basis for each generalized eigenspace of $T$ consisting of a union of disjoint cycles of generalized eigenvectors. Then find a Jordan canonical form $J$ of $T$.

\solution

Let $\alpha$ be $\{1, t, t^2, e^t, te^t\}$ Then

\[
  A = [T]_{\alpha} = \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
\]

Note that this matrix is almost in Jordan canonical form except for $A_{23}$ which should be $1$ instead of $2$. Thus, almost all vectors of $\alpha = \{1, t, t^2, e^t, te^t\}$ can be left unchanged. So instead of $t^2$ we can put $\frac{1}{2}y^2$ in the basis such that $T\left(\frac{1}{2}t^2\right) = t$. Thus, for $\beta = \left\{1, t, \frac{1}{2}t^2, e^t te^t\right\}$, the Jordan canonical form is
\[
J = [T]_\beta = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
