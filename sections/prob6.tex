\begin{homeworkProblem}

Let $U$ be a linear operator on finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Prove the following results:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\rank(U^m) = \rank(U^{m+1})$ for some positive integer $m$, then $N(U^m) = N(U^{k})$ for any positive integer $k \geq m$.
  \item Let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$, and let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $T$. Prove that if $\rank((T - \lambda I)^m) = \rank((T - \lambda I)^{m+1})$ for some positive integer $m$, then $K^\lambda = N((T - \lambda I)^m)$
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Note that
\[
U^{m+1}(V) = U^m (U(V)) \subseteq U^m(V)
\] which means that
\[
\rank(U^{m+1}) \leq \rank(U^m)
\] Since we know that their ranks are equal, then
\[
U^{m+1}(V) = U^m(V)
\] Now
\[
U^{m+2}(V) = U((U^{m+1}(V))) = U((U^{m}(V))) = U^{m+1}(V) = U^m(V)
\] Inductively,
\[
U^k(V) = U^{m+l}(V) = U^m(V)
\] i.e.
\[
\rank(U^k(V)) = \rank(U^m(V))
\] Since $V$ is finite-dimensional with dimension $n$, we know that
\[
\dim(R(U)) + \dim(N(U)) = n
\] for every linear operator $U$ on $V$. Then
\[
\dim(N(U^m)) = n - \rank(U^m) = n - \rank(U^k) = \dim(N(U^k)) \quad \forall k \geq m
\]
  Then, (from the conclusion in the book) we know that
\[
N(U^m) \subseteq N(U^k)
\] Since dimensions are equal, then $N(U^m) = N(U^k)$.
  \item $K_\lambda$ is defined as
\[
K_\lambda = \{x \in V : (T-\lambda I)^p(x) \text{ for some positive integer }p\}
\] which means that
\[
K_\lambda = \{N(T-\lambda I)^p \text{ for some positive integer }p\}
\] Since
\[
N(T-\lambda I) \subseteq N(T-\lambda I)^2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq N(T-\lambda I)^m = N(T-\lambda I)^{m+1} = \cdots
\] clearly,
\[
K_\lambda = N(T-\lambda I)^m
\]

\end{enumerate}
