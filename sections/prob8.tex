\begin{homeworkProblem}

\solution

\begin{proof}
Proving $\det(A) = 0$ is equivalent to proving $A$ is not invertible. Suppose that $A$ is invertible, then we have \[
    AA^{-1} = I
\]
It's trivial to see that when $A$ is nilpotent, we have \[
\begin{aligned}
    (AA^{-1})^{k} &= I \\
    (A^{k})(A^{-k}) &= I \\
    O A^{-k} &= I \\
    O &= I
\end{aligned}
\]
This can never happen. By contradiction we have proven that $A$ is not invertible, thus $\det(A) = 0$ when $A$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof}
